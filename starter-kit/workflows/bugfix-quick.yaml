      Quick bug analysis and fix:
      
      1. **Identify the bug**: Understand what's broken
      2. **Find root cause**: Locate the problematic code
      3. **Implement fix**: Make minimal, focused changes
      4. **Verify**: Confirm the fix works
      
      Keep it simple - no lengthy documentation needed.
